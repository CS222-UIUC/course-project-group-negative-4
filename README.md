### Pitch
UIUC Course Data is an all in one place to help students make informed decisions
regarding course selection. It provides statistical course data such as past semester
grade distributions and reviews from RateMyProfessor and popular Reddit posts.

### Functionality
1. Users can look up a course code (e.g. CS 225) to view what professors have
taught the class in the past.
2. Users will have access to grade disparity (the number of A+’s/A’s/A-’s, etc.) from
past semesters between the sections of different professors.
3. Users will be able to view professor reviews embedded directly from
RateMyProfessors.com
4. Users will be able to view Reddit data relating to top posts on UIUC subreddit
relating to a specific course or professor.

### Development
Best to create a [python virtual environment](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask#ftoc-heading-6). 
Activate the environment by running ```<name of environment>/bin/activate```. If issues arise, write ```source <name of environment>/bin/activate```.

Afte activating virtual env, to install dependencies, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
